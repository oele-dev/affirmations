I need you to create a professional landing page for my product: a tool that converts personal affirmations into professional audio files.

## PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
- Name: [Choose a simple name like "AffirmAudio" or "MyAffirmations" or suggest one]
- Problem: Using generic affirmations don't seem to work because they're not about YOUR specific goals
- Solution: Users paste their custom affirmations → get professional AI voice + 432Hz music → download MP3
- Pricing: $2,99 one-time (early bird from $5)
- Target: People who already use affirmations and want personalized audio (Brian Tracy followers, Law of Attraction community)

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

Use the frontend-design skill.

**Style:**
- Modern, clean, calming aesthetic
- Color scheme: Soft blues/purples (meditation/relaxation vibe)
- Professional but approachable
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth animations (subtle, not distracting)

**Sections (in order):**

1. **HERO SECTION:**
   - Headline: "Your Goals. Your Affirmations. Taylored Audio."
   - Subheadline: "Using generic affirmations don't work because they're not about YOUR specific goals. Create custom affirmations for YOUR life, then turn them into taylored audio you can listen to daily."
   - Email capture form (single input + button)
   - CTA button: "Get Early Access - 50% Off Launch"
   - Background: Gradient or subtle pattern (calming)

2. **PROBLEM SECTION:**
   - Mini headline: "Why Generic Affirmations Fail"
   - 3 pain points with icons:
     ❌ YouTube or Spotify affirmations are too general
     ❌ They don't match your specific goals  
     ❌ Reading them yourself feels awkward
   - Use icons from Lucide Icons or similar

3. **SOLUTION SECTION:**
   - Mini headline: "Finally: Audio Affirmations That Are Actually About YOU"
   - 3-step process with numbers:
     1. Write your personal affirmations (based on YOUR goals)
     2. Choose your voice (AI voice + relaxing music)
     3. Download & listen daily (get MP3)
   - Comparison example:
     "Instead of: 'I am healthy' → You get: 'I weigh 165 pounds and feel energetic'"
   - Placeholder for audio player (just a gray box with "Sample Audio" text for now)

4. **WHO IS THIS FOR:**
   - Mini headline: "Perfect for people who:"
   - 4 checkmarks with text:
     ✓ Already know the power of affirmations
     ✓ Have specific, measurable goals
     ✓ Want to listen vs reading
     ✓ Are tired of generic audios

5. **PRICING SECTION:**
   - Headline: "Early Bird Pricing"
   - Price: ~~$5~~ $2,99 one-time (strikethrough on $10)
   - "No subscription. Use forever."
   - What's included (bullet list):
     • Unlimited custom audios (up to 3 min each)
     • 2 voice options (calm female, confident male)
     • Professional 432Hz background music

   - Email capture form (repeat)
   - CTA: "Join Waitlist - Lock In 50% Off"
   - Small text: "Launch: January 15th. First 100 people get lifetime 50% discount."

6. **FAQ SECTION:**
   - Headline: "Frequently Asked Questions"
   - 4 Q&A accordion/expandable items:
     Q: Do you generate the affirmations for me?
     A: No - you write your own based on your specific goals. This ensures they're 100% personalized to YOUR life.
     
     Q: How is this different from YouTube affirmation videos?
     A: YouTube/Spotify = generic affirmations for everyone. This = YOUR specific goals in professional audio.
     
     Q: Can I use ChatGPT to write my affirmations?
     A: Absolutely! Many users ask ChatGPT for affirmation ideas, then customize them.
     
     Q: How long does it take to generate?
     A: ~60 seconds. Paste text → select voice → download MP3.

7. **FINAL CTA:**
   - Headline: "Ready to hear YOUR goals in professional audio?"
   - Social proof: "Join 147 people waiting for launch" (we'll update number later)
   - Email capture form (final one)

## FILE STRUCTURE:

/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── README.md (with setup instructions)

## DELIVERABLES:

1. Fully functional landing page
2. Mobile responsive (test on 375px, 768px, 1440px)
3. All sections implemented as specified
4. Email forms ready (frontend only, backend integration later)
5. Clean, commented code
6. Instructions on how to:
   - Run locally
   - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
   - Connect email forms to ConvertKit/Mailchimp later

## PLACEHOLDER CONTENT:

- Sample audio player: Just a gray box with text "Sample audio will be embedded here"
- Product name: Suggest 3 options or use "AffirmAudio" as placeholder
- Email counter: Start with "147 people" (I'll update manually)

## NICE TO HAVE (if time permits):

- Dark mode toggle
- Testimonial section (empty for now, ready for future quotes)
- Simple analytics setup (Google Analytics placeholder)
- Open Graph meta tags for social sharing

## FINAL NOTES:

- Code should be production-ready (no console.logs, clean formatting)
- Comments for sections where I'll need to add backend later
- Optimize for fast loading (lazy load images if any)
- Accessibility: proper heading hierarchy, alt texts, ARIA labels
- SEO: meta description, title tag, semantic HTML

Start with the HTML structure, then CSS styling, then JavaScript functionality. Test responsiveness at each step.

Let me know if you need any clarification!
